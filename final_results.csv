464,School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts,1984,"<p>Under the provisions of the Education of the Handicapped Act, state and local education agencies must provide handicapped children and their parents or guardians with access to the appropriate safeguards to ensure free and appropriate public education. Such safeguards include the right of the parents and guardians to participate in the development of an individual education program (IEP) and a procedure for the review of a proposed IEP if there is disagreement.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1979, Michael Panico, who was considered to be “handicapped” under the meaning of the Act, was attending Memorial School, a public school in Burlington. His continued poor performance and the school’s inability to handle his needs led to a discussion between the school district and Michael’s parents about what changes needed to be made to his IEP. In June of 1979, the town presented the Panicos with an IEP that called for Michael to be placed at Pine Glen School. In the meantime, the Panicos had met with specialists at the Massachusetts General Hospital who recommended that Michael’s needs could best be served at the Carroll School in Lincoln, Massachusetts. The Panicos enrolled Michael at the Carroll School at their own expense.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Department of Education’s Bureau of Special Education Appeals (BSEA) held several hearings on the issue and determined that the town’s proposed placement was inappropriate and that the Carroll School was most adequately equipped to meet Michael’s needs. The BSEA ordered the town to pay for Michael’s tuition and transportation, as well as reimburse the Panicos for money already spent. The town sought judicial review in district court under federal and state statutes. The district court granted summary judgment against the town on the state law claim and set a date for trial on the federal claim. Because the town had refused to comply with the BSEA order, the Panicos and the state moved for preliminary injunctive relief. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the judgment in regards to the state law claim and held that none of the parties were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief because none could show irreparable injury. On remand, the district court found in favor of the town that the proposed IEP was appropriate and that the town should not be required to compensate the Panicos. The case was transferred to a different district judge to rule on the issue of whether or not the town should be required to pay the Panicos for costs incurred while the case was pending. The district court held that the Panicos’ decision to place Michael in the Carroll School without the town’s consent absolved the town of financial responsibility while the case was pending and ordered the Panicos to reimburse the town. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and held that the district court erred in conducting an entirely new trial, gave insufficient weight to the BSEA findings, and did not properly evaluate the IEP in question.</p>

607,Graham v. Connor,1988,"<p>On November 12, 1984, Dethorne Graham, a diabetic, had an insulin reaction while doing auto work at his home. He asked a friend, William Berry, to drive him to a convenience store in order to purchase some orange juice to counter his reaction. When they arrived at the store, Graham rapidly left the car. He entered the store and saw a line of four or five persons at the counter; not wanting to wait in line, he quickly left the store and returned to Berry’s car. Officer M.S. Connor, a Charlotte police officer, observed Graham entering and exiting the store unusually quickly. He followed the car and pulled it over about a half mile away.</p>
<p>Graham, still suffering from an insulin reaction, exited the car and ran around it twice. Berry and Officer Connor stopped Graham, and he sat down on the curb. He soon passed out; when he revived he was handcuffed and lying face down on the sidewalk. Several more police officers were present by this time. The officers picked up Graham, still handcuffed, and placed him over the hood of Berry’s car. Graham attempted to reach for his wallet to show his diabetic identification, and an officer shoved his head down into the hood and told him to shut up. The police then struggled to place Graham in the squad car over Graham’s vigorous resistance. Officer Connor soon determined, however, that Graham had not committed a crime at the convenience store, and returned him to his home. Graham sustained multiple injuries, including a broken foot, as a result of the incident.</p>
<p>Graham filed § 1983 charges against Connor, other officers, and the City of Charlotte, alleging a violation of his rights by the excessive use of force by the police officers, unlawful assault, unlawful restraint constituting false imprisonment, and that the City of Charlotte improperly trained its officers in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The City of Charlotte filed for a directed verdict, which the district court granted. Graham appealed the ruling on the use of excessive force, contending that the district court incorrectly applied a four-part substantive due process test from <i>Johnson v. Glick</i> that takes into account officers’ “good faith” efforts and whether they acted “maliciously or sadistically”. He instead argued for a standard of “objective reasonableness” under the Fourth Amendment. The United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, rejected this argument, reasoning that concepts such as ""good faith"" are relevant to determining the degree of force used. It affirmed the directed verdict, holding that a reasonable jury could not have found in Graham’s favor.</p>

1593,Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,2003,"<p>A U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) special agent was kidnapped and murdered by a Mexican drug cartel in 1985. After an investigation, the DEA concluded that Humberto Alvarez-Machain had participated in the murder. A warrant for his arrest was issued by a federal district court. The DEA, however, was unable to convince Mexico to extradite Alvarez-Machain, so they hired several Mexican nationals to capture him and bring him back to the United States. His subsequent trial went all the way to the Supreme Court, which found that the government could try a person who had been forcibly abducted, but that the abduction itself might violate international and provide grounds for a civil suit. When the case went back to the district court for trial, Alvarez-Machain was found not guilty for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Alvarez-Machain then filed a group of civil suits in federal court against the United States and the Mexican nationals who had captured him under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which allows the federal government to be sued on tort claims, and the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), which permits suits against foreign citizens in American courts. The government argued that the FTCA applied only to claims arising from actions that took place in the United States and therefore did not cover Alvarez-Machain's case because the arrest took place in Mexico. Further, the government and the Mexican nationals argued that the ATS gave federal courts jurisdiction to hear tort claims against foreign citizens, but did not allow private individuals to bring those suits.</p>
<p>The federal district court disagreed with the government's contention that the FCTA claim did not apply, finding that plan to capture Alvarez-Machain was developed on U.S. soil and therefore covered. However, the court then ruled that the DEA had acted lawfully when they arrested Alvarez-Machain and was therefore not liable. On the ATS claims, the court rejected the argument that private individuals could not bring suit under the Act. The court found that Jose Francisco Sosa, one of the Mexican nationals who kidnapped Alvarez- Machain, had violated international law and was therefore liable under the ATS.</p>
<p>On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the district court's FTCA decision, ruling that the DEA could not authorize a citizen's arrest of Alvarez-Machain in another country and was therefore liable. The appeals court did, however, affirm the lower court's finding on the ATS claim, upholding the judgment against Sosa.</p>

1876,Boumediene v. Bush,2007,"<p>In 2002 Lakhdar Boumediene and five other Algerian natives were seized by Bosnian police when U.S. intelligence officers suspected their involvement in a plot to attack the U.S. embassy there. The U.S. government classified the men as enemy combatants in the war on terror and detained them at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, which is located on land that the U.S. leases from Cuba. Boumediene filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging violations of the Constitution's Due Process Clause, various statutes and treaties, the common law, and international law. The District Court judge granted the government's motion to have all of the claims dismissed on the ground that Boumediene, as an alien detained at an overseas military base, had no right to a habeas petition. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal but the Supreme Court reversed in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, which held that the habeas statute extends to non-citizen detainees at Guantanamo.</p>
<p>In 2006, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). The Act eliminates federal courts' jurisdiction to hear habeas applications from detainees who have been designated (according to procedures established in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005) as enemy combatants. When the case was appealed to the D.C. Circuit for the second time, the detainees argued that the MCA did not apply to their petitions, and that if it did, it was unconstitutional under the Suspension Clause. The Suspension Clause reads: ""The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.""</p>
<p>The D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the government on both points. It cited language in the MCA applying the law to ""all cases, without exception"" that pertain to aspects of detention. One of the purposes of the MCA, according to the Circuit Court, was to overrule the Supreme Court's opinion in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, which had allowed petitions like Boumediene's to go forward. The D.C. Circuit held that the Suspension Clause only protects the writ of habeas corpus as it existed in 1789, and that the writ would not have been understood in 1789 to apply to an overseas military base leased from a foreign government. Constitutional rights do not apply to aliens outside of the United States, the court held, and the leased military base in Cuba does not qualify as inside the geographic borders of the U.S. In a rare reversal, the Supreme Court granted certiorari after initially denying review three months earlier.</p>

1926,Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee,2008,"<p>In February 2001 Jacqueline Fitzgerald, a kindergarten student, told her parents that an older student on the school bus, on several occasions, bullied her into lifting up her skirt. Jacqueline's mother reported these allegations to the school but its immediate investigation into the matter, including interviewing the supposed perpetrator, the school bus driver, and many students on the bus, did not provide any further proof of the sexual harassment. After Jacqueline told her parents about further instances of mistreatment, the local police department began its own investigation but was unable to find sufficient evidence to bring criminal proceedings against the alleged harasser. Jacqueline reported other incidents throughout the year, and each was addressed by the school's principal as it occurred. In April of 2002 the Fitzgeralds brought suit against the school district in federal court alleging violations of both Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 and 42 U.S.C. 1983 (Section 1983). Title IX prohibits discrimination by any educational entity receiving federal funding, while Section 1983 protects against the deprivation of any rights guaranteed by the Constitution and federal laws. The district court granted the school district's motion to dismiss both counts and the Fitzgeralds appealed.</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of both claims. First, discussing the Title IX claim, the court stated that five conditions must be met for a plaintiff to succeed: the student must prove that (1) the institution is a recipient of federal funding, (2) severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment occurred, (3) the harassment denied the student of educational opportunities or benefits, (4) the institution had actual knowledge of the harassment, and (5) the institution's deliberate indifference caused the student to be subjected to the harassment. The First Circuit held that even if the first four factors were met in this case, the school's ""prompt"" and ""diligent"" investigation was not clearly unreasonable and therefore did not amount to deliberate indifference. Rather, the school looked into each allegation quickly and thoroughly. The court also affirmed the dismissal of the Fitzgeralds' Section 1983 claim, applying the so-called ""remedial"" exception prohibiting such claims when the allegedly violated federal law is itself specific enough to demonstrate Congress' intention to allow only those remedies referred to in the statute itself. According to the First Circuit, Title IX is one of these remedial statutes and therefore any alleged violations of the statute cannot be litigated under Section 1983.</p>

Home Concrete then closed the short sales by purchasing and returning essentially identical Treasury Bonds on the open market for $7,359,043.

2183,Armour v. City of Indianapolis,2011,"<p>In April of 2001, the City of Indianapolis (""the city"") sent a letter to property owners in the Northern Estates neighborhood informing them that their properties were part of the Brisbane/Manning Barrett Law Sanitary Sewers Project (""the project""). The project was designed to connect properties to the city sewer system, reducing or eliminating the use of septic tanks.</p>
<p>In July of 2004, the Indianapolis Board of Public Works (""the board"") levied an assessment of $9,278 against each property subject to the project. Indianapolis offered each property owner the option of paying the assessment in its entirety or of paying in monthly installments, subject to an annual interest rate. The petitioners, Christine Armour and 30 other property owners (""property owners""), chose to pay the assessment in its entirety.</p>
<p>In 2005, the city abandoned the Barrett Law method of assessing owners' contributions in favor of the Septic Tank Elimination Program (""STEP""). As part of the transition to STEP, the board passed a measure forgiving all outstanding Barrett Law assessment balances owed as of November 1, 2005, including those assessed for the project. As a result, owners who chose to pay their assessment in monthly installments were forgiven from future payment. Owners who chose to pay their assessments in their entirety were given no reimbursement. The property owners requested compensation from the board in February of 2006 and were denied.</p>

",majority opinion,Christine Armour,City of Indianapolis,False,Economic Activity,2877,"<p>In April of 2001, the City of Indianapolis (""the city"") sent a letter to property owners in the Northern Estates neighborhood informing them that their properties were part of the Brisbane/Manning Barrett Law Sanitary Sewers Project (""the project""). The project was designed to connect properties to the city sewer system, reducing or eliminating the use of septic tanks.</p>
<p>In July of 2004, the Indianapolis Board of Public Works (""the board"") levied an assessment of $9,278 against each property subject to the project. Indianapolis offered each property owner the option of paying the assessment in its entirety or of paying in monthly installments, subject to an annual interest rate. The petitioners, Christine Armour and 30 other property owners (""property owners""), chose to pay the assessment in its entirety.</p>
<p>In 2005, the city abandoned the Barrett Law method of assessing owners' contributions in favor of the Septic Tank Elimination Program (""STEP""). As part of the transition to STEP, the board passed a measure forgiving all outstanding Barrett Law assessment balances owed as of November 1, 2005, including those assessed for the project. As a result, owners who chose to pay their assessment in monthly installments were forgiven from future payment. Owners who chose to pay their assessments in their entirety were given no reimbursement. The property owners requested compensation from the board in February of 2006 and were denied.</p>

The city's rationale for this decision, as noted by Justice Frank Sullivan, is that owners who fully paid their assessments were in a better financial position than those making monthly installments, and that the benefits of simplifying funding for the sewer system outweighed the effort of continuing the previous taxation system. This rationale provides a rational basis for the city's actions, and therefore, the city's tax policy survives rational basis review. Additionally, the property owners were not singled out for discriminatory treatment, and thus, do not constitute a ""class of one"" requiring heightened scrutiny of the city's action. As a result, I would rule in favor of the City of Indianapolis, and against Christine Armour and the other property owners.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[' Based on the facts of the case, I would rule in favor of the City of Indianapolis because the city\'s decision to forgive the assessment balances of owners who chose to pay in monthly installments, while not providing reimbursement to those who paid in full, was rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

The ACA also contained an expansion of Medicaid, which states had to accept in order to receive Federal funds for Medicaid, and an employer mandate to obtain health coverage for employees.</p>
<p>Shortly after Congress passed the ACA, Florida and 12 other states brought actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida seeking a declaration that the ACA was unconstitutional on several grounds. These states were subsequently joined by 13 additional states, the National Federation of Independent businesses, and individual plaintiffs Kaj Ahburg and Mary Brown.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argued that: (1) the individual mandate exceeded Congress' enumerated powers under the Commerce Clause; (2) the Medicaid expansions were unconstitutionally coercive; and (3) the employer mandate impermissibly interfered with state sovereignty.</p>
<p>The District Court first addressed whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit. It determined that Brown had standing to challenge the minimum coverage provision because she did not have health insurance and had to make financial arrangements to ensure compliance with the provision, which would go into effect in 2014. The court further determined that Idaho and Utah had standing because each state had enacted a statute purporting to exempt their residents from the minimum coverage provision.</p>
<p>The court also concluded that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar the suit.</p>
<p>The District Court then addressed the constitutional questions. It ruled that the individual mandate provision was not a valid exercise of Congress' commerce or taxing powers. The court held the entire act invalid because the mandate could not be severed from any other provision.

<p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed 2-to-1 the District Court's holdings as to the Medicaid expansions and the individual mandate.

2270,Trevino v. Thaler,2012,"<p>On the night of June 9, 1996, Carlos Trevino and four others drove to a nearby store to pick up beer for a party. One of the men noticed 15-year old Linda Salinas and offered to drive her to a nearby restaurant. Instead, the group drove Linda to Espada Park in San Antonio, Texas where they started to sexually assault her. Trevino's cousin, Juan Gonzalez, refused to participate and returned to the car; meanwhile, Trevino and the three other men continued the assault. Linda's body was discovered in the park the next day with fatal stab wounds to her neck.</p>
<p>After their investigation, the San Antonio Police arrested Trevino and a grand jury indicted him on one count of intentional murder and attempt to commit aggravated sexual assault. At trial, Trevino's cousin Gonzalez testified against him. Gonzalez testified that the men returned to the car with blood on their shirts discussing the murder, with Trevino bragging about how he learned to kill in prison. With this evidence, the jury found Trevino guilty and was left to decide on an appropriate punishment. They determined that Trevino intended to kill Linda and was likely to commit such violent acts in the future. At the jury's suggestion, the trial court sentenced Trevino to death.</p>
<p>Through both the punishment phase of the trial and the first state habeas corpus proceeding, Trevino's attorney did not investigate or present any mitigating evidence that could have reduced Trevino's sentence. During the federal habeas proceeding that followed, Trevino's attorney withdrew and the court appointed new counsel. Trevino's new counsel undertook his own investigation and discovered several pieces of evidence that the jury could have found relevant during the punishment phase of the trial.</p>
<p>Trevino returned to state court and filed a second habeas corpus application on the basis that his first attorney had a duty to investigate and present the mitigating evidence. Since the attorney failed to do so, Trevino claimed that his Sixth Amendment right to a competent attorney had been denied. The state court denied his application, stating that Trevino should have presented the ineffective assistance of counsel claim during the first state habeas proceeding. Trevino returned to the federal district court to reassert this claim, but that court also denied his claim because it was never properly raised in state court. The district court went on to explain that the allegedly ineffective performance of his first attorney during state habeas proceedings did not excuse his failure to present an ineffective assistance of counsel claim during those proceedings. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision and Trevino appealed further. The Supreme Court granted certiorari limited to the question below.</p>

2348,National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning,2013,"<p>The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) established the National Labor Relations Board (Board) to decide labor disputes among employers, unions, and employees. Parties first file unfair labor practice allegations to a Regional Office, which then conducts an investigation and, if necessary, files a complaint. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) presides over the hearing on the complaint and issues a recommendation to the Board. Unless a party to the dispute files a timely appeal, the ALJ's recommendation becomes the final order of the Board. To hear a case and issue a ruling, the Board must have at least three of its five members present. The NLRA allows parties to appeal a Board ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the area where the alleged unfair labor practice occurred or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Board members are appointed by the president and serve five-year terms.</p>
<p>In 2010, Noel Canning, a bottler and distributor of Pepsi-Cola products, was engaged in negotiations with its employee union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 760 (Union). During the final bargaining session that December, Noel Canning agreed to submit two wage and pension plans to a vote by the Union membership. The membership approved the union's preferred proposal. However, Noel Canning argued that the discussions did not amount to a binding agreement and refused to incorporate the changes into a new collective bargaining agreement. The Union filed a complaint with the Board alleging that Noel Canning's actions constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of the NLRA. An ALJ determined that the agreement was binding and ordered Noel Canning to sign the collective bargaining agreement. The Board affirmed the ruling against Noel Canning.</p>
<p>Noel Canning appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which held that the Board's ruling was invalid because not enough members of the Board were present. The panel that heard the Noel Canning case consisted of one member who was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2010 and two members whom President Obama appointed without Senate confirmation in January 2012. Although the Recess Appointments Clause allows the president to fill vacancies that occur while Congress is in recess, between December 2011 and the end of January 2012, the Senate met in pro forma meetings every three business days. Therefore, the Court of Appeals determined that the Senate was not in recess on the days the Senate did not meet because, for the purpose of the Recess Appointments Clause, recess is defined as the time in between sessions of Congress.</p>

2399,Davis v. Ayala,2014,"<p>Hector Ayala, a Hispanic man, was charged with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder stemming from a failed robbery. During jury selection for his trial in California state court, the prosecution used seven preemptory challenges to exclude each black or Hispanic prospective juror. Ayala challenged the prosecution's use of preemptory challenges as a violation of the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Batson v. Kentucky</em>, which held that the exclusion of jurors on the basis of race was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In accordance with <em>Batson</em>, if a party can make a prima facie showing that preemptory challenges are being used in a racially motivated way, the other party must give a non-racially motivated reason for their use of the preemptory challenges. The state court allowed the prosecution to give their non-racially motivated reasons in a closed hearing, from which Ayala and his attorneys were excluded, and subsequently found the prosecution's use of preemptory challenges was not racially motivated. Ayala was not given the prosecution's reasoning or a transcript of the meeting until after the conclusion of his trial. Additionally, after the trial it was discovered that the vast majority of the questionnaires all the potential jurors had to fill out had been lost. Ayala was found guilty of the majority of the charges against him and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>On appeal, the California Supreme Court found that the state court erred in excluding Ayala from the <em>Batson</em> hearing, but that error as well as the loss of the questionnaires were harmless, and therefore upheld Ayala's conviction. Ayala appealed to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and argued that the <em>Batson</em> hearing procedure and loss of the questionnaires violated his constitutional rights. In accordance with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the appellate court found that the California Supreme Court had not adjudicated Ayala's claims of federal constitutional violations on the merits largely on the basis that the California Court had determined the procedure used for the <em>Batson</em> hearing violated California state law; therefore the appellate court reviewed Ayala's claims <em>de novo</em> and found that the exclusion of Ayala from the <em>Batson</em> hearing, as well as the loss of the questionnaires, violated Ayala's constitutional rights. To determine whether the errors were harmless, the Court of Appeals applied the standard set forth in <em> Brecht v. Abrahamson</em> , which asked whether the errors had a substantial and injurious influence on the jury's verdict, and found that the exclusion of Ayala from the Batson  hearing deprived him of the ability to prevail on a compelling <em>Batson</em> challenge.</p>

The key issue here is whether the employees' strike was protected under the NLRA. Although the collective bargaining agreement between the company and the union was still in effect when the employees went on strike, the agreement itself provided a mechanism for amendment or termination, which included a 60-day notice period. However, this notice period is not the same as the notice period required by the NLRA. The NLRA provides that employees may not strike until 60 days after written notice of intent to terminate or modify the contract, but it does not require that the contract itself be terminated or modified in a specific manner. In this case, the union provided written notice of its desire to modify the agreement on August 24, 1951, and the parties met multiple times to discuss the proposed amendments, but no agreement was reached. The employees' strike on April 30, 1952, was more than 60 days after the union's notice, and therefore, the strike was not in violation of the NLRA. The company's refusal to reinstate the striking employees unless they agreed to work for a period of at least one year without work stoppage was an unfair labor practice, as it interfered with the employees' right to strike and bargain collectively. Therefore, I rule in favor of the NLRB, finding that the company engaged in unfair labor practices under the NLRA.","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]","["" The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is seeking to enforce its decision that the Lion Oil Company (now part of Monsanto Chemical Company) engaged in unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

However, the agreement itself provided a mechanism for amendment and termination, which included a 60-day period for negotiations. Since no agreement was reached within that period and neither party explicitly terminated the contract, the strike that occurred on April 30, 1952, can be seen as a response to the stalemate in negotiations rather than a clear violation of the NLRA's provisions regarding strikes during the term of a collective bargaining agreement. The company's refusal to reinstate striking employees unless they agreed to work for a year without any stoppage can be viewed as an attempt to impose conditions that undermine the employees' rights under the NLRA.

2683,Chapman v. California,1966,"<p>On October 17, 1962, Ruth Elizabeth Chapman and Thomas LeRoy Teale registered at a motel in Fresno, California. At approximately 2:00 A.M. the following day, Chapman and Teale appeared at the Spot Club in Lodi. The only persons at the bar were Teale, Chapman, and the club’s bartender, Billy Dean Adcock. A short time later, a witness observed three persons in front of the Spot Club: a woman of Chapman’s general description and Adcock stood in front of the club’s door, while a man resembling Teale stood behind Adcock while he apparently locked the door.</p>
<p>The next day, the Spot Club’s owner found the club in disarray; someone had broken into the cash register and approximately $260 was missing. Routine housekeeping tasks normally performed by Adcock were left undone. Later, Adcock body’s was found in a remote area north of Lodi, half buried in an open roadside ditch. The time of death was approximately 3:00 AM on October 18th. Adcock was shot three times in the head. The bullets were fired from a .22 caliber weapon similar to one purchased by Chapman while with Teale in Reno, Nevada, six days before the killing. The gun was not found.</p>
<p>Officers arrested Teale in New Orleans on November 2, 1962. He carried a gun purchased the same day as Chapman’s .22 caliber weapon. An agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Chapman in St. Joseph, Missouri on October 26, 1962. She gave conflicting accounts of her whereabouts on October 17 and 18, but a registration card from October 18 for occupancy of a motel room in Woodland, California was made out in her handwriting.</p>
<p>Chapman and Teale were charged with the first degree murder of Adcock. A prisoner locked up with Teale testified that Teale did not plan on killing Adcock, but when Chapman and Teale released Adcock from their car outside of Lodi, Chapman shot him once in the back of the head and twice more when he was on the ground. Neither defendant appeared as a witness, but Chapman’s conflicting testimony was introduced by direct examination of the FBI agent. The trial court instructed the jury that they could draw adverse conclusions from the defendants’ failure to testify. The jury convicted both defendants of first degree murder. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court held in <i>Griffin v.

2969,Welch v. United States,2015,"<p>Police entered Gregory Welch’s apartment because they had reason to believe that a robbery suspect was on the premises. After obtaining Welch’s consent to search the apartment, the police located a gun and ammunition that Welch later identified as his own. Welch was subsequently arrested and charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, and he pleaded guilty. Because Welch had three prior felony convictions, the district court determined that the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) required that he be sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison. Welch appealed his sentence and argued that one of his felonies, a conviction for “strong arm” robbery in Florida state court in 1996, did not qualify as a predicate offense for the purpose of the ACCA because, at the time he was convicted, Florida state law allowed for a conviction of robbery with a much lower level of force than the federal law required. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s determination that Welch’s conviction for robbery under Florida state law was a predicate offense for the purpose of the ACCA because it involved force that was “capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.”</p>

The Court held that the residual clause violated the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments because it was so vague that it failed to give people adequate notice of the conduct it punished.

3018,County of Los Angeles v. Mendez,2016,"<p dir=""ltr"">In October 2010, Deputies Christopher Conley and Jennifer Pederson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department responded to a tip from an informant that wanted parolee Ronnie O’Dell had been seen in front of the nearby residence of Paula Hughes. The officers were informed that Angel Mendez and Jennifer Lynn Garcia lived together in the backyard of the Hughes residence. Although they did not have a search warrant, other officers directed Deputies Conley and Pederson to search the backyard. After determining that O’Dell was not in any of the three storage sheds in Hughes’ backyard, the deputies proceeded to a wooden shed surrounded by an A/C unit, clothes locker, clothes, and other belongings. The deputies did not knock and announce their presence. Deputy Conley, upon opening the door, saw the silhouette of a person holding a rifle through a curtain in the shed. Conley yelled “Gun!” and both deputies proceeded to shoot Mendez and Garcia. Whether Mendez was merely moving the gun or was pointing it at the deputies was subject to conflicting testimony at trial. As a result, Mendez required amputation of his right leg below the knee, and Garcia was shot in the back. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Mendez and Garcia sued Conley and Pederson and alleged that the deputies, in their official capacity, deprived them of their Fourth Amendment rights by performing an unjustified warrantless search and that the deputies failed to adhere to the knock-and-announce rule, which requires that officers announce their presence before they enter a home. The district court found for the plaintiffs on both these allegations and also held that, although the officers’ use of force was reasonable under the circumstances, they were liable for the shooting under the Ninth Circuit’s provocation rule. That rule holds an officer liable for use of deadly force where the officer intentionally or recklessly provokes a violent confrontation via a Fourth Amendment violation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s determination that the search violated the Fourth Amendment but reversed the knock-and-announce rule holding that because there was no controlling Ninth Circuit precedent on whether officers must announce themselves again at a separate residence on the same property.  The appellate court also held that the officers were liable under the provocation rule because their unjustified search of the occupied shed led to the shooting.</p>

3068,Byrd v. United States,2017,"<p>Terrence Byrd was driving on a divided four-lane highway near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, when he was pulled over allegedly for violating a state law requiring drivers to use the left lane for passing only. Recognizing the car as a rental car, the officers asked Byrd for his license and rental agreement, which he had difficulty locating. Once he did locate them, the officers noted that the rental agreement did not list Byrd as an authorized driver, and when they ran his identification, they noted that he was using an alias and had an outstanding warrant in New Jersey. Despite the warrant’s indication that it did not request extradition from other jurisdictions, the officers attempted to contact authorities in New Jersey to confirm they did not seek Byrd’s arrest and extradition, allegedly following protocol for such situations. The officers experienced difficulty with their communications, however, and returned to Byrd’s car, where they asked him to exit the vehicle and about his warrant and alias.</p>
<p>The officers asked whether Byrd had anything illegal in the car and then requested Byrd’s consent to search the car, noting that they did not actually need his consent because he was not listed on the rental agreement. The officers allege that Byrd gave his consent, but Byrd disputes this contention. The subsequent search turned up heroin and body armor in the trunk of the car.</p>
<p>At trial, Byrd moved to suppress the evidence, challenging the initial stop, the extension of the stop, and the search. The district court determined that the violation of the traffic law justified the initial stop and that the extension of the stop was justified by the officers’ developing reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Byrd maintains that he did not consent to the search, so the issue remains whether he needed to consent at all—that is, whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle, despite not being listed on the rental agreement. If he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, then the officers’ search of the vehicle did not require his consent.</p>
<p>There is a circuit split as to whether an unlisted driver of a rental car has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle, and the Third Circuit (where the district court in this case sits) has held that such a driver does not. Thus, the district court denied Byrd’s motion to suppress, and the Third Circuit, reviewing the factual questions for clear error and the legal question de novo, affirmed the judgment of the district court.</p>

3086,"Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Florida",2017,"<p>Fane Lozman was a resident of the City of Riviera Beach (the “City”), where he was a vocal critic of the City’s plan to utilize eminent domain to redevelop the Riviera Beach Marina. After the redevelopment plan was approved, Lozman filed suit against the City under the Florida Sunshine Law, seeking to invalidate the City’s approval of the plan due to insufficient public notice for the emergency meeting during which the plan had been approved. The city council met in a closed session to discuss the lawsuit, and the meeting transcript seemed to reflect councilmembers suggesting that the City should employ intimidation tactics in fighting Lozman’s claim. </p>
<p>On November 15, 2006, Lozman attended a regularly scheduled city council meeting and was granted permission to speak during the non-agenda public comment portion of the meeting. When it was his turn to speak, he attempted to begin discussing corruption in local government, and a councilmember instructed him to discontinue his comments on that topic. Lozman repeatedly ignored the councilmember’s instructions, and she ultimately instructed a City police officer to arrest Lozman. </p>
<p>Lozman was charged with, inter alia, disturbing a lawful assembly. The prosecuting attorney concluded that there was probable cause for the arrest, but dismissed the charges on the grounds that successful prosecution was unlikely. </p>
<p>In February 2008, Lozman filed suit against the City under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on the grounds that the City had arrested him at the city council meeting in retaliation for his opposition to the redevelopment plan. He alleged (1) retaliation by false arrest under the First Amendment, (2) unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and (3) common law false arrest. The case went to trial in November 2014 with Lozman appearing pro se. The jury found in favor of the City on all claims. Lozman filed a motion for a new trial, which the district court denied. </p>
<p>On appeal, Lozman argued that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the jury’s finding of probable cause on the charge of disturbing a lawful assembly was against the great weight of the evidence. The Eleventh Circuit rejected this contention in light of the evidence presented at trial. It further explained that under its own precedent, a finding of probable cause bars a claim for false arrest under the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, and state law. </p>
<p>The Eleventh Circuit also rejected Lozman’s challenge to the district court’s instruction on retaliatory animus, stating that any error the instruction may have contained was harmless because the jury’s probable cause finding defeated Lozman’s retaliatory arrest claim as a matter of law. The appeals court also rejected Lozman’s challenge to the lower court’s jury instructions regarding the City’s authority to limit public comment during city council meetings.

The statute\'s broad prohibition on political apparel at polling places, without a clear definition of what constitutes ""political,"" creates a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The state\'s interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation at polling places is important, but the statute\'s sweeping restriction on political expression is not the least restrictive means to achieve this goal. Therefore, the statute, as applied to the Tea Party apparel in this case, violates the First Amendment, and the ruling should favor the Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, which prohibits individuals from wearing political apparel at or around polling places, raises significant First Amendment concerns. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, including symbolic speech such as wearing apparel with political messages. The statute\'s broad prohibition, coupled with the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes ""political"" apparel, creates a risk of arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement. This vagueness can lead to the suppression of protected speech, which is particularly concerning in the context of a polling place, where the expression of political views is inherently tied to the democratic process. The Eighth Circuit\'s reliance on the reasonableness of the statute\'s application to Tea Party apparel is insufficient to justify the restriction on speech. The Supreme Court has consistently held that restrictions on speech in public forums must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and must leave open ample alternative channels for communication. The Minnesota statute fails to meet this standard, as it imposes a broad ban on political expression without sufficient justification or precision. Therefore, the Court should rule in favor of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al., and find the statute unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.', ' The Minnesota statute prohibiting political apparel at polling places, as applied in this case, violates the First Amendment. The statute\'s broad and undefined prohibition on ""political"" apparel creates a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, which chills protected speech. While the government has a legitimate interest in maintaining order and decorum at polling places, the statute\'s lack of specificity and the potential for selective enforcement undermine its constitutionality. The Tea Party apparel in question does not pose a threat to the integrity of the electoral process, and the state\'s interest in preventing voter intimidation or electioneering does not justify such a sweeping restriction on political expression. The First Amendment requires a more narrowly tailored approach to regulating speech in this context. Therefore, I would rule in favor of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, as applied to the Minnesota Voters Alliance and its associates, imposes an unreasonable restriction on political speech in violation of the First Amendment. The statute\'s prohibition on wearing political apparel at or near polling places is overly broad and vague, particularly given the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes ""political"" apparel. The policy materials distributed by election officials to interpret the statute do not provide sufficient clarity or guidance, leading to arbitrary enforcement. The case of Andrew Cilek, who was temporarily prevented from voting due to wearing a Tea Party logo and a button advocating for photo ID requirements, illustrates the statute\'s potential for inconsistent and selective application. While the state has a legitimate interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation at polling places, the complete ban on all political apparel is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The Eighth Circuit\'s reliance on the assumption that the Tea Party is a political entity, without specific evidence to support the reasonableness of the ban in this context, further undermines the statute\'s constitutionality as applied. Therefore, the statute violates the First Amendment rights of the Minnesota Voters Alliance and its associates, and the lower courts\' rulings should be reversed.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, which prohibits individuals from wearing political apparel at or around polling places on primary or election days, raises significant First Amendment concerns. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, and this includes the right to express political beliefs through apparel. The statute\'s broad prohibition, without a clear and precise definition of what constitutes ""political"" apparel, creates a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. This vagueness can lead to inconsistent application, as seen in the case of Andrew Cilek, who was temporarily prevented from voting due to his Tea Party logo and a button advocating for photo ID requirements. The lack of a clear standard for what is considered political apparel undermines the statute\'s constitutionality. Furthermore, the potential for selective enforcement, as suggested by the petitioners, exacerbates the risk of unequal treatment under the law. Given these concerns, the statute\'s restrictions on political speech at polling places are not sufficiently narrowly tailored to serve the state\'s interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation. Therefore, the statute violates the First Amendment, and the ruling should favor the Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, as applied to the Minnesota Voters Alliance and associated parties, infringes upon their First Amendment rights. The statute\'s prohibition on wearing political apparel at polling places is overly broad and lacks a precise definition of what constitutes ""political"" apparel, leading to arbitrary enforcement. The policy materials distributed by election officials to identify prohibited items do not provide sufficient clarity or consistency, which can result in the suppression of protected speech. The First Amendment guarantees the right to free expression, and the government must demonstrate a compelling interest to justify any restriction on this right. In this case, the state\'s interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation at polling places does not outweigh the fundamental right to free speech, especially when the enforcement of the statute appears to be selective and inconsistent. Therefore, the statute, as applied, is unconstitutional, and the Minnesota Voters Alliance should prevail in their claim.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, as applied to the Minnesota Voters Alliance and its associates, infringes upon their First Amendment rights. The statute\'s prohibition on wearing political apparel at polling places is overly broad and lacks a precise definition of what constitutes ""political"" apparel, leading to arbitrary enforcement. The case of Andrew Cilek, who was temporarily prevented from voting due to his Tea Party logo t-shirt and a button advocating for photo ID requirements, exemplifies the statute\'s potential for suppressing free expression. The Eighth Circuit\'s affirmation of the district court\'s dismissal of the as-applied First Amendment claim overlooks the fundamental principle that the government must demonstrate a compelling interest to justify such restrictions on speech, especially in a context as critical as the polling place. The lack of specific facts showing the unreasonableness of banning Tea Party apparel does not negate the broader constitutional issue at stake. Therefore, the Supreme Court should rule in favor of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, recognizing that the statute, as applied, violates the First Amendment by imposing an unreasonable restriction on political speech without a sufficiently narrow tailoring to serve a compelling state interest.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, as applied in this case, imposes a restriction on political speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. The First Amendment protects the right to engage in political expression, including the wearing of political apparel, even in the vicinity of polling places. While the state has a legitimate interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation or confusion at polling places, the broad and undefined prohibition on ""political"" apparel, as enforced by Minnesota election officials, risks suppressing a wide range of protected speech without clear justification. The lack of a precise definition of ""political"" in the statute and the potential for arbitrary enforcement further undermine its constitutionality. The Eighth Circuit\'s reliance on the reasonableness of the statute\'s application to Tea Party apparel is insufficient to justify the restriction, as it fails to address the broader implications for free speech. Therefore, the statute, as applied in this case, violates the First Amendment, and the Court should rule in favor of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al.', ' The Minnesota statute prohibiting political apparel at polling places, as applied to the Tea Party logo and photo ID advocacy button, violates the First Amendment. The statute\'s broad and undefined prohibition on ""political"" apparel creates a risk of arbitrary enforcement and chills protected speech. While the government has a legitimate interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation at polling places, the statute is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The Tea Party is not a recognized political party in Minnesota, and the apparel in question did not pose a clear threat to the polling place\'s integrity or function. The lack of a precise definition of ""political"" and the potential for selective enforcement further undermine the statute\'s constitutionality. Therefore, the statute, as applied in this case, impermissibly restricts free speech and cannot stand under the First Amendment.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, which prohibits individuals from wearing political apparel at or around polling places on primary or election days, raises significant First Amendment concerns. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, and this includes the right to express political views through apparel. The statute\'s broad prohibition, without a clear definition of what constitutes ""political"" apparel, creates a risk of arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement, which can chill protected speech. The fact that election officials were given discretion to interpret and enforce the statute further exacerbates this issue, as it allows for potential viewpoint discrimination. While the state has a legitimate interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation at polling places, the statute as applied in this case is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The Tea Party logo and the button advocating for photo ID requirements are forms of political expression that do not inherently disrupt the voting process or intimidate voters. Therefore, the statute, as applied to the plaintiffs, violates their First Amendment rights, and the lower courts\' rulings should be reversed.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, as applied in this case, imposes a restriction on political speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.

While the state has a legitimate interest in maintaining order and decorum at polling places, the statute\'s application to apparel such as a Tea Party logo and a button advocating for photo ID requirements is overly broad and not reasonably necessary to achieve that interest.

The Supreme Court should rule in favor of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al., as the statute does not meet the strict scrutiny required for restrictions on political speech, especially in a context as critical as the exercise of the right to vote. The lack of a clear, narrowly tailored standard to serve a compelling state interest renders the statute unconstitutional as applied in this case.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, which prohibits individuals from wearing political apparel at or around polling places, raises significant First Amendment concerns. The statute\'s broad and undefined prohibition on ""political"" apparel, coupled with the potential for misdemeanor prosecution, imposes a substantial burden on free speech rights. The First Amendment protects the right to engage in political expression, and the government\'s interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation at polling places must be balanced against this fundamental right. The lack of a clear definition of ""political"" in the statute and the subjective enforcement by election officials create a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory application, which undermines the statute\'s constitutionality. Furthermore, the fact that the Tea Party is not a recognized political party in Minnesota does not diminish the expressive nature of the apparel in question. The Eighth Circuit\'s reliance on the absence of specific facts showing the unreasonableness of the ban is insufficient to justify the restriction on speech. Therefore, the statute, as applied to the Minnesota Voters Alliance and its members, violates the First Amendment, and the lower courts\' rulings should be reversed.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, which prohibits individuals from wearing political apparel at or around polling places, raises significant First Amendment concerns.

The statute\'s prohibition on wearing political apparel at polling places, without a clear and precise definition of what constitutes ""political"" apparel, creates a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. This vagueness undermines the statute\'s constitutionality, as it fails to provide adequate notice to individuals about what is prohibited and grants excessive discretion to election officials. Furthermore, the state\'s interest in maintaining order and preventing voter intimidation at polling places, while legitimate, does not justify a blanket ban on all political apparel, particularly when less restrictive means could achieve the same goal. The Eighth Circuit\'s reliance on the assumption that the Tea Party is a political entity, without requiring specific evidence to support this conclusion, further weakens the state\'s argument. Given these considerations, the statute, as applied to the Minnesota Voters Alliance and its members, violates the First Amendment, and the lower courts\' rulings should be reversed.', ' The Minnesota statute § 211B.II, as applied to the Minnesota Voters Alliance and associated parties, infringes upon the First Amendment rights of free speech.

3092,China Agritech v. Resh,2017,"<p>China Agritech is a holding company incorporated in Delaware, with a principal place of business in Beijing. The company represented that it manufactured and sold organic compound fertilizers and other agricultural products to farmers in over two dozen provinces throughout China. It listed its shares on NASDAQ in 2005, and in 2009 reported to the SEC a net revenue of triple the amount it had reported four years earlier. In 2011, company shareholders alleged fraudulent business practices by China Agritech. The company denied the allegations and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation, and subsequently dismissed its independent auditor. Later that year, NASDAQ halted trading in and initiated delisting proceedings against China Agritech’s stock, and in 2012 the SEC revoked the stock’s registration.</p>
<p>Shareholders sued China Agritech in two successive putative class actions in 2011 and 2012, alleging various securities law violations against the company and several individual defendants. Class certification was denied in both cases.</p>
<p>Shareholder Michael Resh brought a third putative class action against the company and individual defendants in 2014, alleging securities law violations arising from the same facts and circumstances as the first two cases. China Agritech moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that it had been filed after the two year limitations period applicable under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Resh and the additional plaintiffs argued that under the <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction v. Utah</em> line of cases, the limitations period had been tolled on their claims during the pendency of the two prior class actions. The district court rejected this contention, finding that under <em>American Pipe</em> and its progeny, the limitations period was tolled as to individual class members, but that the Supreme Court had not decided whether an entirely new class action based on a substantially identical class was subject to the same rule. It ruled that the limitations period was therefore tolled as to the individual claims of the named plaintiffs in the instant case, but not as to the putative class.</p>
<p>The Ninth Circuit reversed, with a three-judge panel finding that the plaintiffs’ class action would not be time-barred where: (1) the named plaintiffs had been unnamed in the two prior suits, which were against many of the same defendants and involved the same underlying events; (2) the two prior cases were timely; (3) class certification was denied in the earlier actions; and (4) pursuant to the <em>American Pipe</em> line of cases, the named plaintiffs’ individual claims were tolled during the pendency of the two prior class actions. The panel explained that permitting such claims to go forward was consistent with the policy goals of tolling in general. The panel further stated that in light of FRCP 23’s requirements, as well as principles of comity and preclusion, the existing legal system contains sufficient safeguards to prevent litigants from filing repetitious actions in light of this ruling.</p>

In this case, the plaintiffs sought to bring a new class action after the statute of limitations had expired, relying on the tolling doctrine.

3096,Abbott v. Perez,2017,"<p>Individual voters in Texas, along with organizations representing Latinos and African Americans, filed a number of lawsuits in 2011, challenging the Texas legislature’s congressional and state house redistricting plans. The actions were consolidated and proceed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (“Texas District Court”). The plaintiffs alleged racial gerrymandering in violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) as well as the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution. At that time Texas was bound by the preclearance requirements under § 5 of the VRA, and therefore the State simultaneously filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (“D.C. District Court”) seeking preclearance of the redistricting plans. </p>
<p>While trial proceedings were pending in both district courts, the 2012 primary elections were approaching. As a result, the Texas District Court assumed the task of implementing interim redistricting plans, which it did on an expedited basis, without access to all relevant facts, and with the understanding that most parties to the litigation alleged that those plans contained many of the same statutory and constitutional infirmities as the challenged plans. The U.S. Supreme Court vacated the first iteration of the interim maps on the grounds that the court had not been sufficiently deferential to the legislature; the Texas District Court issued more deferential plans in February 2012. </p>
<p>The D.C. District Court subsequently denied preclearance to the proposed redistricting plans on the basis that they were enacted with discriminatory intent and had the effect of abridging minority voting rights. Texas appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>After the Texas District Court’s interim maps were used for the 2012 elections, the Texas legislature failed to take any action on redistricting in the 2013 regular session. However, it convened a special session during which it adopted, among others, the Texas District Court’s congressional interim map (“Plan C235”) without any changes. The governor subsequently signed the legislation adopting this plan.</p>
<p>In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>, which removed the § 5 preclearance requirements from the VRA. Texas was therefore no longer automatically subject to preclearance requirements, and the U.S. Supreme Court later vacated and remanded for further proceedings the D.C. District Court’s preclearance decision, which the lower court then dismissed as moot.</p>
<p>The defendants subsequently sought to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims in the Texas District Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the case had become moot. In response, the plaintiffs expressed their desire to amend their complaints regarding the 2011 plans and to challenge the 2013 plans. The court granted them leave to amend, and denied the State’s motions to dismiss. The court explained that the plaintiffs’ claims regarding the 2011 plans were not moot because, <em>inter alia</em>, the plaintiffs continued to be harmed by them. The court also ordered that the 2013 plans, which included Plan C235, be used for the 2014 elections. The plaintiffs then filed their amended complaints, including claims related to both the 2011 and 2013 plans. Most plaintiffs included claims that Plan C235 violated § 2 of the VRA and the 14th and 15th Amendments.</p>
<p>The Texas District Court held trials on the 2011 plans in 2014, and found that they violated certain aspects of § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. In the ongoing litigation, the plaintiffs contended that the 2013 plans, including Plan C235, included some of the same elements that the court determined were the result of discriminatory intent or statutory or constitutional violations as in the 2011 plans.</p>
<p>In August 2017, the Texas District Court issued an interlocutory order regarding the plaintiffs’ C235 claims. It found that the racially discriminatory intent and effects identified in the 2011 plans carried through to the 2013 plans where the redistricting lines remained the same. It explained that the legislature had adopted the court’s interim plans (which included C235) as part of a litigation strategy that was designed to insulate the plans from any further challenge. The legislature had not engaged in any deliberative process to remove the discriminatory elements from the plans before adopting them, but instead intentionally furthered and continued the discrimination in the existing plans.</p>
<p>The court also concluded that the configurations of CD 27 and CD 35 under Plan C235 violated § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. As to CD 27, though the court had found in 2012 that this district did not reflect a racially discriminatory purpose because it was not possible to create an additional Latino opportunity district in the region, the Texas legislature had still engaged in vote dilution. Regarding CD 35, the court stated that while C235 was enacted in 2013, the challenged district boundaries that it reflected were drawn in 2011 and found to violate § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. The court explained that the Texas legislature did not engage in any meaningful effort to cleanse the discriminatory elements from the 2013 plan before it was adopted, and in fact intended to maintain that discrimination in enacting the plan in substantially the same form. </p>
<p>The court additionally found that the plaintiffs had proven a § 2 “results” violation as to CD 27, HD 32, and HD 34, and a racial gerrymandering claim as to HD 90.</p>
<p>The court’s order directed the Texas Attorney General to issue a written advisory within three days as to whether the legislature would convene a special session to address the issue of redistricting. If the legislature did not plan to hold a special session, the parties were ordered to appear before the court to prepare remedial redistricting plans. </p>

1. **2011 Redistricting Plans**: The Texas legislature passed redistricting plans, which were challenged by various groups, including the NAACP and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).

6. **Interlocutory Order**: The Texas District Court issued an interlocutory order in August 2017, finding that Plan C235 violated § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment.
7. **U.S. Supreme Court Appeal**: The defendants appealed the Texas District Court's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case on the merits in January 2018.

The key issues in the case include:

* Whether the 2011 and 2013 redistricting plans were enacted with discriminatory intent and had the effect of abridging minority voting rights.
* Whether Plan C235, which was adopted by the Texas legislature in 2013, carries through the same discriminatory elements as the 2011 plans.
* Whether the Texas District Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case, given the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder.

3109,Trump v. Hawaii,2017,"<p>On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order No. 13,769 (EO-1), which, among other things, suspended entry for 90 days of foreign nationals from seven countries identified by Congress or the Executive as presenting heightened terrorism-related risks. EO-1 was immediately challenged in federal district court, and the judge entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit denied the government's emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal. Rather than continuing to litigate the matter, the government announced that it would revoke that order and issue a new one.</p>
<p>On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,780 (EO-2). Section 2(c) of EO-2 directed that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO-1 be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of the order, citing a need for time to establish adequate standards to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists. Section 6(a) directed that applications for refugee status and travel of refugees into the United States under the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) be suspended for 120 days from the effective date ""to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures."" Section 6(b) suspended the entry of any individual under USRAP once 50,000 refugees have entered the United States in fiscal year 2017. The effective date of the order was March 16, 2017. EO-2 was subject to swift litigation as well.</p>
<p>On June 14, just before Section 2(c) of EO-2 was by its terms set to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials declaring the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO–2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases “are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision."" The government sought review in both cases, making arguments both on the merits of the cases and on procedural issues.</p>
<p>In a per curiam opinion issued simultaneously with an order granting certiorari, the Court granted the government's applications for a stay of the preliminary injunction with respect to Sections 6(a) and (b) of Executive Order 13,780 (EO-2), thereby allowing enforcement of those provisions. Under the Court's ruling, the government may enforce Section 6(a) except as to any ""individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,"" nor may such an individual be excluded under Section 6(b).</p>
<p>On September 24, 2017—the same day EO-2 was expiring—President Donald Trump issued a Proclamation restricting travel to the United States by citizens from eight countries.

",majority opinion,"Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.","Hawaii, et al.",True,Civil Rights,3000,"<p>On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order No. 13,769 (EO-1), which, among other things, suspended entry for 90 days of foreign nationals from seven countries identified by Congress or the Executive as presenting heightened terrorism-related risks. EO-1 was immediately challenged in federal district court, and the judge entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit denied the government's emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal. Rather than continuing to litigate the matter, the government announced that it would revoke that order and issue a new one.</p>
<p>On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,780 (EO-2). Section 2(c) of EO-2 directed that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO-1 be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of the order, citing a need for time to establish adequate standards to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists. Section 6(a) directed that applications for refugee status and travel of refugees into the United States under the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) be suspended for 120 days from the effective date ""to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures."" Section 6(b) suspended the entry of any individual under USRAP once 50,000 refugees have entered the United States in fiscal year 2017. The effective date of the order was March 16, 2017. EO-2 was subject to swift litigation as well.</p>
<p>On June 14, just before Section 2(c) of EO-2 was by its terms set to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials declaring the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO–2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases “are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision."" The government sought review in both cases, making arguments both on the merits of the cases and on procedural issues.</p>
<p>In a per curiam opinion issued simultaneously with an order granting certiorari, the Court granted the government's applications for a stay of the preliminary injunction with respect to Sections 6(a) and (b) of Executive Order 13,780 (EO-2), thereby allowing enforcement of those provisions. Under the Court's ruling, the government may enforce Section 6(a) except as to any ""individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,"" nor may such an individual be excluded under Section 6(b).</p>
<p>On September 24, 2017—the same day EO-2 was expiring—President Donald Trump issued a Proclamation restricting travel to the United States by citizens from eight countries. That Proclamation too was challenged in federal court as attempting to exercise power that neither Congress nor the Constitution vested in the president.

Francis Lorenzo, as the director of investment banking, disseminated misleading information to potential investors regarding the financial status of Waste2Energy Holdings (W2E). Despite the fact that Lorenzo did not draft the emails himself and was acting under the direction of his superiors, he still played a significant role in the dissemination of false information. The Supreme Court has previously held in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.

However, Lorenzo's active participation in sending the emails, which contained materially false statements, and his failure to disclose the devaluation of W2E's intangible assets, constitutes a violation of the securities laws. The SEC's charges under Sections 17(a)(1) and 10(b), as well as Rule 10b-5, are supported by the facts that Lorenzo willfully engaged in fraudulent behavior by misleading investors.

Although the DC Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the finding regarding Rule 10b-5(b), citing the Supreme Court\'s decision in Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, which limits liability to the ""maker"" of a statement, the overall context of Lorenzo\'s actions and the findings of the ALJ and the Commission suggest that his conduct was in violation of securities laws.

The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and the full Commission found that Lorenzo had willfully violated these provisions.

Although the DC Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the finding that Lorenzo violated Rule 10b-5(b) based on the ""maker"" standard established in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.

Given the evidence of Lorenzo\'s involvement in disseminating misleading information and the upheld violations of securities laws, the decision does not favor Lorenzo. Therefore, the ruling is in favor of the SEC, not Lorenzo.', ' The facts of the case indicate that Francis Lorenzo, while acting as the director of investment banking at Charles Vista, LLC, sent emails to potential investors containing misleading information about Waste2Energy Holdings (W2E).

While the DC Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the finding that Lorenzo violated Rule 10b-5(b) based on the Supreme Court\'s decision in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.

Given that Lorenzo\'s actions involved willful misrepresentation and omission of material facts, which are central to securities fraud, the ruling against him is justified under the applicable laws and precedents in place at the time. Therefore, I would not rule in favor of Lorenzo.', ' The Supreme Court ruled against Francis Lorenzo, holding that he could be held liable for disseminating false or misleading statements to investors, even if he did not ""make"" the statements under the definition set forth in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.

The Court emphasized that individuals who disseminate false statements with the intent to defraud can be held liable, regardless of whether they are the ""maker"" of the statement under *Janus*. Thus, the ruling favored the Securities and Exchange Commission, not Lorenzo.', ' The facts of the case indicate that Francis Lorenzo, while acting as the director of investment banking, sent emails to potential investors containing materially misleading statements about the financial health and assets of Waste2Energy Holdings (W2E).

Lorenzo\'s actions were found to violate securities-fraud provisions, specifically Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Rule 10b-5. Although the DC Circuit reversed the finding that Lorenzo violated Rule 10b-5(b) based on the ""maker"" doctrine established in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Lorenzo with violating securities-fraud provisions, including Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5. Although the DC Circuit reversed the finding that Lorenzo violated Rule 10b-5(b) based on the Supreme Court’s decision in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders* (2011), which limited liability to the “maker” of a false statement, Lorenzo’s actions still constituted a violation of the broader anti-fraud provisions. The SEC’s findings that Lorenzo willfully engaged in fraudulent conduct were upheld by the DC Circuit for two of the three provisions. Given the evidence of Lorenzo’s involvement in disseminating misleading information to investors, I would rule against him and affirm the SEC’s findings of liability under the applicable securities laws.', ' The Supreme Court ruled against Francis V. Lorenzo, holding that he could be held liable for disseminating false or misleading statements to investors, even if he did not ""make"" the statements under the definition set forth in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.

The Court emphasized that Lorenzo\'s role in sending the emails with materially misleading information, regardless of whether he authored the statements, was sufficient to establish liability under the securities laws. Thus, the Court upheld the SEC\'s findings and ruled against Lorenzo.', ' The facts of the case indicate that Francis Lorenzo, while acting as the director of investment banking, sent emails to potential investors containing materially false statements about the financial condition of Waste2Energy Holdings (W2E).

Although the DC Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the finding that Lorenzo violated Rule 10b-5(b) based on the ""maker"" theory established in *Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.

3147,Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt,2018,"<p>In 1993, a tax auditor for the Franchise Tax Board of California (FTB) read a newspaper about Gilbert P. Hyatt, an inventor, and the large amounts of money he was making from the patent. The auditor decided to investigate Hyatt, and, after finding some discrepancies, opened an audit on Hyatt’s 1991 state tax return. In conducting the audit, the auditor found additional discrepancies  surrounding Hyatt’s move from California to Nevada and opened an audit as to his 1992 tax returns. FTB determined that Hyatt owed $1.8 million in state income taxes, plus $1.4 million in penalties and $1.2 million in interest, resulted in a tax assessment of $4.5 million for Hyatt’s 1991 tax year. FTB further found that Hyatt owed over $6 million in taxes and interest for 1992, plus penalties.</p>
<p>Hyatt challenged the conclusions by filing protests with FTB and then in California courts. In 1998, Hyatt sued FTB in Nevada state court seeking damages for intentional torts and bad-faith conduct allegedly committed by FTB auditors during tax audits of Hyatt’s 1991 and 1992 state tax returns.</p>
<p>FTB filed a motion for partial summary judgment challenging the Nevada district court’s jurisdiction over Hyatt’s declaratory relief cause of action. The district court granted partial summary judgment, finding that the timing of Hyatt’s move from California to Nevada should be resolved via the administrative investigation. FTB also asked the Nevada Supreme Court to decide whether it was entitled to complete immunity under several theories: it enjoyed complete immunity under California law, it was entitled to sovereign immunity, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and comity. The Nevada Supreme Court concluded FTB was not entitled to complete immunity under any of these principles, but was entitled to partial immunity equal to the immunity a Nevada government agency would receive. Thus, the court concluded that FTB was immune from the negligence cause of action, but not from the intentional tort causes of action.</p>
<p>FTB appealed to the US Supreme Court, and the Court upheld the court’s determination that FTB was entitled only to partial immunity under comity principles. Two other questions from this litigation made their way to the US Supreme Court, and the Court (1) split 4–4 as to whether it should overrule <em>Nevada v. Hall</em>, which provides “that one State … can open the doors of its courts to a private citizen’s lawsuit against another State … without the other State’s consent,” and (2) held that the Constitution does not permit Nevada to award damages against California agencies under its state law that are greater than it could award against Nevada agencies in similar circumstances. With these preliminary legal questions resolved, a Nevada jury finally found in favor of Hyatt and awarded him $85 million for emotional distress, $52 million for invasion of privacy, over $1 for special damages for fraud, and $250 million in punitive damages. The Nevada Supreme Court issued upholding the damages, subject to the statutory caps to which FTB is entitled, consistent with the US Supreme Court’s holding on that issue.</p>

3150,Nutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert,2018,"<p>Troy Lambert purchased an alleged aphrodisiac dietary supplement that was manufactured by Nutraceutical, but that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based on the product’s labels, Lambert believed that the supplement would enhance his sexual performance, and had he known these claims were false, he would not have purchased the product. </p>
<p>Lambert believed that the product violated FDA regulations because it purported to increase sexual desire but had not been through clinical testing, and because it was not FDA-approved. He further alleged that the product illegally failed to prominently display this lack of FDA approval on its labeling, and that the labeling also failed to mention a potentially dangerous ingredient. Lambert filed a consumer class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 23(b)(3), alleging state law claims related to unfair competition, false advertising, and other violations.</p>
<p>The district court granted class certification based on the full refund damages model, which applies when a product is useless and involves calculating the average retail price and the number of units sold. The judge hearing the case retired, and Lambert’s action was reassigned to a new judge. Discovery was completed, and Nutraceutical filed a motion for decertification. The new judge granted the motion, finding that Lambert had failed to provide essential evidence to apply his classwide damages model, meaning that common issues did not predominate as required under Rule 23(b)(3). </p>
<p>Ten days after the order was issued decertifying the class, Lambert informed the court that he intended to file a motion for reconsideration, and the court instructed him to file the motion within ten days, which was twenty days after the decertification order. In accordance with the court’s instructions, Lambert filed his motion for reconsideration ten days later, highlighting evidence from his class certification motion that could be used to support the full refund damages model. He also offered an alternative damages model for the first time, based on non-restitutionary engorgement. </p>
<p>Three months later, the court denied his motion for reconsideration, rejecting his proposed damages models. Lambert timely filed a petition under Rule 23(f) for permission to appeal the district court’s orders denying the motion for reconsideration and granting the motion for class decertification to the 9th Circuit, which conditionally granted his petition.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit held that Lambert’s Rule 23(f) petition for class certification had been timely filed with the appellate court. The court explained that because Rule 23(f)’s 14-day deadline was procedural rather than jurisdictional, equitable exceptions such as tolling could apply. It also held that filing a motion for reconsideration before the Rule 23(f) deadline would toll the deadline. The panel further held that other circumstances could toll the deadline. In this case, Lambert had informed the district court of his intention to file a motion for reconsideration within Rule 23(f)’s 14-day window, and had submitted the filing within the ten-day time frame set by that court. The panel concluded that under these circumstances the deadline should be tolled and Lambert’s motion for reconsideration should be considered timely filed with the Ninth Circuit, while recognizing that a number of other circuits would likely reach the opposite conclusion.</p>

<p>Petitioner Bradley Taggart is a real estate developer who owned 25% interest in Sherwood Park Business Center (“SPBC”). Respondents Terry Emmert and Keith Jehnke also each owned a 25% interest in SPBC. In 2007, Taggart purported to transfer his share of SPBC to his attorney, John Berman.</p>
<p>Emmert and Jehnke sued Taggart and Berman in Oregon state court, alleging that the transfer violated SPBC’s operating agreement by not allowing Emmert and Jehnke the right of first refusal. Emmert and Jehnke also sought attorneys’ fees. Taggart moved to dismiss the claim and filed a counterclaim for attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p>In November 2009, shortly before the case went to trial, Taggart filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The state-court action was stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy petition, and in February 2010, Taggart received his discharge in the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>After the discharge, Emmert and Jehnke, represented by attorney Stuart Brown, continued the state-court action. Taggart was largely absent from subsequent proceedings, although Berman renewed his motion to dismiss on Taggart’s behalf at the close of evidence. After a trial, the state court ruled in favor of Emmert and Jehnke and unwound the transfer of Taggart’s share of SPBC to Berman and expelled Taggart from the company. The state court entered a judgment that allowed any party to petition for attorneys’ fees, which led to yet more complicated litigation in state and federal courts.</p>
<p>Brown, the attorney for Emmert and Jehnke, filed a petition for attorneys’ fees in state court on behalf of SPBC, Emmert, and Jehnke, against both Berman and Taggart, but limiting fees against Taggart to those incurred after the date of Taggart’s bankruptcy discharge. The petition notified the court of Taggart’s bankruptcy discharge but argued he could still be liable for attorneys’ fees on the theory that Taggart had “returned to the fray.”</p>
<p>While the attorneys’ fee petition was pending in state court, Taggart sought to reopen his bankruptcy proceeding in bankruptcy court. Once reopened, Taggart asked the court to hold Brown, Jehnke, Emmert, and SPBC (collectively the “Creditors”) in contempt for violating the bankruptcy discharge by seeking an award of attorneys’ fees against him in the state court action.</p>
<p>The state court ruled that Taggart had “returned to the fray” as a matter of law, so he could be held liable for attorneys’ fees incurred after his bankruptcy. Taggart timely appealed the state-court determination.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the bankruptcy court denied Taggart’s motion for contempt, agreeing with the state court that Taggart had “returned to the fray.” On appeal, the district court reversed, finding that Taggart’s actions did not constitute a “return to the fray” and thus the discharge injunction barred the claim against him for attorneys’ fees. The district court remanded for a determination whether the Creditors had “knowingly violated the discharge injunction in seeking attorneys’ fees.” On remand, the bankruptcy court found they had knowingly violated the discharge injunction and thus held them in contempt. On appeal, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (“BAP”) reversed the bankruptcy court’s finding of contempt, finding they had a good faith belief that the discharge injunction did not apply to their attorneys’ fee claim.</p>
<p>Back in state court, the state appellate court found that Taggart’s actions did not constitute a “return to the fray” and thus reversed the state trial court as to its ruling on attorneys’ fees.

Hunt",2018,"<p>The US Department of Defense awarded petitioner The Parsons Corporation a $60 million contract to perform munitions cleanup in Iraq. One component of the contract was that Parsons must provide adequate security to its employees who would be performing the cleanup. After seeking bids for a subcontract, a Parsons committee awarded it to ArmorGroup. Although petitioner Cochise Consultancy had submitted a bid, it did not win the subcontract. However, an Army Corps of Engineers contracting officer, Wayne Shaw, whom Cochise had allegedly bribed undertook elaborate efforts—including forgery, deception, and threats—to induce Parsons to award the subcontract to Cochise rather than to ArmorGroup. One employee in particular refused to award the subcontract to Cochise, believing that the award was made in violation of government regulations. That employee was replaced, and his replacement allowed the award of the subcontract to Cochise to move forward.</p>
<p>From February to September 2006, Cochise provided security services under the subcontract. Each month, the US government paid Cochise at least $1 million more than it would have paid ArmorGroup had ArmorGroup been awarded the subcontract, plus other expenses related to Cochise not being adequately equipped to perform the services required. In 2006, Shaw, who had orchestrated the fraudulent award of the subcontract to Cochise, rotated out of Iraq, and Parsons immediately reopened the subcontract for bidding and awarded it to ArmorGroup.</p>
<p>Several years later, in 2010, FBI agents interviewed Parsons employee Billy Joe Hunt about his role in a separate kickback scheme, and during that interview Hunt informed the agents about the contractors’ fraudulent scheme involving the subcontract for security services. Hunt was charged with federal crimes related to the kickback scheme and served ten months in federal prison.</p>
<p>After he was released, in 2013, Hunt filed a <em>qui tam</em> action under seal alleging that Parsons and Cochise had violated the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–33, by submitting to the United States false or fraudulent claims for payment. The United States declined to intervene in the action, and Hunt’s complaint was unsealed. The contractors moved to dismiss, arguing that Hunt’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1), which requires a civil action alleging an FCA violation to be brought within the later of (1) “6 years after the date on which the violation … is committed” or (2) “3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances….” The district court granted the contractors’ motion to dismiss, finding that under either provision, Hunt’s claim would be time-barred. Reviewing the district court’s dismissal <em>de novo</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded. The Eleventh Circuit held that when Hunt (the relator) learned of the fraud is immaterial for statute of limitation purposes, and thus the period began to run when government officials learned of the facts giving rise to the claim.</p>

The contractors moved to dismiss, arguing that Hunt’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1), which requires a civil action alleging an FCA violation to be brought within the later of (1) “6 years after the date on which the violation … is committed” or (2) “3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances….” The district court granted the contractors’ motion to dismiss, finding that under either provision, Hunt’s claim would be time-barred. Reviewing the district court’s dismissal <em>de novo</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded. The Eleventh Circuit held that when Hunt (the relator) learned of the fraud is immaterial for statute of limitation purposes, and thus the period began to run when government officials learned of the facts giving rise to the claim.</p>",0,0," The False Claims Act (FCA) violation occurred when Cochise Consultancy, Inc. submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States, and the statute of limitations for such claims is governed by 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1).

In 1977, Atlantic Richfield purchased Anaconda Smelter, and it shut down smelter activities in 1980. The smelter operations over the almost-century of operations caused high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium, and zinc to contaminate soil, groundwater, and surface water. In 1983, the EPA prioritized the Anaconda Smelter site as a Superfund site, working with Atlantic Richfield to address the contamination. Since then, Atlantic Richfield has worked with the EPA for 35 years to remediate the site, at a cost of approximately $470 million.</p>
<p>In 2008, landowners within the Anaconda Superfund site sued Atlantic Richfield in Montana state court, alleging that the smelter operations between 1884 and 1980 had caused damage to their properties. Atlantic Richfield raised no objections to the plaintiffs’ claims of loss of use and enjoyment of property, diminution of value, incidental and consequential damages, and annoyance and discomfort. However, it did object to the common-law claim for “restoration” damages.</p>
<p>To establish a claim for restoration damages in Montana, plaintiffs must prove that they will actually use the award to clean up the site. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that restoration of their property requires “work in excess of what the EPA required of Atlantic Richfield in its selected remedy.” Atlantic Richfield moved for summary judgment, arguing that the restoration claim constituted a “challenge” to the EPA’s remedy and thus was jurisdictionally barred by CERCLA § 113, which deprives courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to EPA-selected remedies. Atlantic Richfield also argued that the landowners are “potentially responsible parties” and thus must seek EPA approval under 42 U.S.C. § 9622(e)(6) of CERCLA before engaging in remedial action. Finally, Atlantic Richfield argued that CERCLA preempted state common-law claims for restoration.</p>
<p>The trial court held that CERCLA permitted plaintiffs’ claim for restoration damages, and Atlantic Richfield sought a writ of supervisory control from the Montana Supreme Court, which the court granted. Over a dissent, the Supreme Court of Montana rejected all three of Atlantic Richfield’s arguments, affirming the trial court’s decision permitting the plaintiffs to proceed to a jury trial on their restoration claim.</p>

The plaintiffs in this case alleged that restoration of their property requires “work in excess of what the EPA required of Atlantic Richfield in its selected remedy.” Atlantic Richfield moved for summary judgment, arguing that the restoration claim constituted a “challenge” to the EPA’s remedy and thus was jurisdictionally barred by CERCLA § 113, which deprives courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to EPA-selected remedies. Atlantic Richfield also argued that the landowners are “potentially responsible parties” and thus must seek EPA approval under 42 U.S.C. § 9622(e)(6) of CERCLA before engaging in remedial action. Finally, Atlantic Richfield argued that CERCLA preempted state common-law claims for restoration.</p>
<p>The trial court held that CERCLA permitted plaintiffs’ claim for restoration damages, and Atlantic Richfield sought a writ of supervisory control from the Montana Supreme Court, which the court granted. Over a dissent, the Supreme Court of Montana rejected all three of Atlantic Richfield’s arguments, affirming the trial court’s decision permitting the plaintiffs to proceed to a jury trial on their restoration claim.</p>",1,0," The court rules in favor of Gregory A.

Additionally, the landowners, as potentially responsible parties, are required to seek EPA approval before engaging in any remedial action, which they have not done. Finally, CERCLA preempts state common-law claims for restoration in this context. Thus, the arguments presented by Atlantic Richfield are valid, and the claim for restoration damages should not proceed."", "" The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980, establishes a federal framework for addressing hazardous waste sites and provides the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with authority to respond to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances. CERCLA § 113(h) explicitly limits judicial review of EPA-selected remedies, which is intended to prevent delays in the cleanup process. In this case, the landowners' claim for restoration damages seeks to impose additional cleanup requirements beyond those mandated by the EPA, which constitutes a challenge to the EPA's selected remedy. This challenge is jurisdictionally barred by CERCLA § 113(h). Furthermore, CERCLA preempts state common-law claims that interfere with the federal cleanup scheme. Therefore, Atlantic Richfield's arguments are valid, and the landowners' restoration claim should not proceed, as it undermines the EPA's authority and the federal framework established by CERCLA.""]",100.0
3207,McKinney v. Arizona,2019,"<p>By way of relevant background, James McKinney’s childhood was “horrific” due to poverty, physical and emotional abuse—all detailed in the court filings. Around age 11, he began drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, and he dropped out of school in the seventh grade. He repeatedly tried to run away from home and was placed in juvenile detention.</p>
<p>In 1991, when McKinney was 23, he and his half-brother Michael Hedlund committed two burglaries that resulted in two deaths. The state of Arizona tried McKinney and Hedlund before dual juries. McKinney’s jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder (without specifying whether it reached that verdict by finding premeditation or by finding felony murder), and Hedlund’s jury found him guilty of one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder.</p>
<p>At McKinney’s capital sentencing hearing (before a judge), a psychologist testified that he had diagnosed McKinney with PTSD “resulting from the horrific childhood McKinney had suffered.” The psychologist further testified that witnessing violence could trigger McKinney’s childhood trauma and produce “diminished capacity.” The trial judge credited the psychologist’s testimony, but under Arizona law at the time, the judge was prohibited from considering non-statutory mitigating evidence that the judge found to be unconnected to the crime. Because McKinney’s PTSD was not connected to the burglaries, the judge could not consider it mitigating evidence and thus sentenced him to death.</p>
<p>The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed McKinney’s death sentence on appeal. In 2003, McKinney filed a habeas petition in federal court. The district court denied relief, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and held that the Arizona courts had violated the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <a href=""https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-5727""><em>Eddings v.

Here, the Arizona courts initially failed to consider McKinney\'s PTSD as mitigating evidence, which the Ninth Circuit correctly identified as a violation of *Eddings*. However, the procedural posture of the case and the application of *Ring v. Arizona* complicate the matter. *Ring* requires that a jury, not a judge, make the findings necessary to impose the death penalty. The Arizona Supreme Court determined that McKinney\'s case was ""final"" before *Ring* was decided, meaning the new rule from *Ring* did not apply retroactively to his case. This determination aligns with the general principle that new constitutional rules of criminal procedure do not apply retroactively to cases that are already final on direct review, as established in *Teague v. Lane*, 489 U.S. 288 (1989). Therefore, while the initial failure to consider McKinney\'s PTSD was unconstitutional under *Eddings*, the procedural limitations imposed by *Ring* and *Teague* mean that McKinney is not entitled to resentencing by a jury.

Aurelius Investment, LLC",2019,"<p>Since it was ceded to the United States in 1898, Puerto Rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large part due to its ambiguous legal status as a protectorate of the United States and the economically detrimental policies the United States has enacted over the decades. Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico’s debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a “death spiral” and was unable to pay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico’s budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama appointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists supplied by Republic and Democratic lawmakers.</p>
<p>A number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama’s authority to appoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress’s plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not “Officers of the United States.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the Territorial Clause does not supersede the application of the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory and that the board members are “Officers of the United States” because: (1) they occupy “continuing positions,” (2) exercise “significant authority” that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be “Officers of the United States,” and (3) exercise their authority “pursuant to the laws of the United States.” Moreover, these officers are “principal” officers subject to the Appointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.</p>

However, the board members, while exercising significant authority, were appointed to address a specific, extraordinary financial crisis in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States. Their roles and responsibilities are tied to the unique circumstances of Puerto Rico's financial oversight and do not equate to the typical roles of principal officers as outlined in the Appointments Clause. Therefore, the appointment process used for the board members was appropriate under the circumstances, and the board's actions are valid under the framework established by PROMESA."", ' The Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico was established under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which was enacted by Congress to address Puerto Rico\'s fiscal crisis. The board\'s creation and the appointment of its members were actions taken under the authority granted by Congress through PROMESA. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires Senate confirmation for principal officers of the United States, but the board members were appointed by the President based on lists provided by members of Congress, which suggests a different process was intended by the legislation. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled that the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government and that the board members are not ""Officers of the United States,"" which would exempt them from the Appointments Clause requirements. Given the unique status of Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory and the specific circumstances of its fiscal crisis, it is reasonable to conclude that the appointment process for the board members was consistent with the intent of PROMESA and the broader constitutional framework governing territories. Therefore, the decision of the federal district court should be upheld, and the ruling should be in favor of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico.', ' The Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico was established under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which was enacted by Congress to address the financial crisis in Puerto Rico. The board\'s creation and the appointment of its members were actions taken under the authority granted by Congress through PROMESA. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires Senate confirmation for high-level federal officers, but the board members were appointed based on lists provided by Republican and Democratic lawmakers, which suggests a process that was intended to be consistent with the Appointments Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled that the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government and that the board members are not ""Officers of the United States,"" which would exempt them from the Appointments Clause requirements. Given that the board was established to manage Puerto Rico\'s financial crisis and that its members were appointed in a manner intended to be consistent with constitutional requirements, the ruling in favor of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico is justified.', ' The Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico was established under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which was enacted by Congress under its plenary powers granted by the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Appointments Clause requires that principal officers of the United States be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, the Board members, while appointed by the President, were not confirmed by the Senate, leading to the challenge. The Supreme Court, in considering the structure and purpose of PROMESA, would likely find that the Board members are not ""Officers of the United States"" but rather local officers of Puerto Rico, given their specific role in managing the financial affairs of the territory. This interpretation aligns with the historical understanding of the Territorial Clause, which grants Congress broad authority to govern territories without the same constitutional constraints that apply to federal officers. Therefore, the Court would likely rule in favor of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, upholding the district court\'s decision that the Board members are not subject to the Appointments Clause.', ' The Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico was established under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which was enacted by Congress under its plenary powers granted by the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The argument that the board members are ""Officers of the United States"" subject to the Appointments Clause overlooks the unique status of Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory and the broad authority Congress has over such territories. The board functions as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government, established to manage and restructure Puerto Rico\'s debt, and its members were appointed in a manner consistent with the legislative framework set forth by Congress. Therefore, the appointment process does not violate the Appointments Clause, and the board\'s authority should be upheld to fulfill its critical role in addressing Puerto Rico\'s financial crisis.', ' The Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico was established under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which was enacted by Congress under its plenary powers granted by the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The board\'s creation and the appointment of its members were intended to address the severe financial crisis in Puerto Rico, a matter of significant federal interest. The argument that the board members are ""Officers of the United States"" subject to the Appointments Clause is not persuasive in this context because the board operates as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, not as a federal agency. The Territorial Clause grants Congress broad authority to govern U.S. territories, and the establishment of the board falls within this constitutional framework. Therefore, the appointment process for the board members, as outlined in PROMESA, is consistent with constitutional requirements, and the board\'s authority is valid. Thus, the ruling should favor the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico.', ' The Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico was established under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which was enacted by Congress to address the fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico.

3218,Babb v. Wilkie,2019,"<p>Petitioner Noris Babb worked as a pharmacist for the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Bay Pines, Florida, since 2004. While there, she helped to develop the Geriatric Pharmacotherapy Clinic (GPC), which serves older veterans with diseases or disabilities common to individuals of advanced age with military service. In 2009, Pharmacy Management gave Babb an advanced scope (full practice authority) to prescribe medications without a physician, which was necessary for her position. In 2010, the VA rolled out a nationwide treatment initiative similar to the GPC Babb had helped develop. Against recommendations by Human Resources and despite requests from doctors, Pharmacy Management rejected applications by several current module pharmacists—all females over 50—and granted applications of two pharmacists under 40.</p>
<p>Two of the female pharmacists who were denied advancement filed Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaints, and Babb provided statements and testified in support of their EEO claims. The pharmacists claimed that their non-selection purportedly for lack of advanced scopes was pretext for discrimination and that any justification for denying advanced scopes was pretext for discrimination as well.</p>
<p>Babb alleged that as a result of her participation in the EEO process, she was denied opportunities to participate in the new program and that Pharmacy Management required her to agree to a schedule that was unworkable for her department. Unable to meet this requirement, Babb’s advanced scope was removed and was consequently disqualified from promotion. A female pharmacist under 30 without an advanced scope was selected for the promotion.</p>
<p>Babb brought this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) alleging that she was the victim of gender-plus-age discrimination and that the VA retaliated against her for participating in protected EEO in violation of those laws. The district court granted summary judgment for the VA. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Babb argued that the district court erred in part by not allowing her to prove that illegal discrimination or retaliation was a “motivating factor” behind the VA’s refusal to promote her. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the lower court, finding itself bound by precedent that federal sector employees’ claims under ADEA and Title VII require that the plaintiff show discrimination or retaliation is a “but for” factor in the adverse personnel action.</p>

<p>In 2003, the two parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a trademark dispute in which Lucky Brand agreed not to use “Get Lucky” and Marcel agreed to release certain claims it might have in the future arising out of its trademarks. The two parties contest the scope of Marcel’s release of claims, with Marcel contending that it only released claims as to infringement that occurred prior to the 2003 execution of the agreement and Lucky Brand arguing that it released any future claim Marcel may have in relation to any trademark registered prior to the execution of the agreement. Further litigation ensued.</p>
<p>In litigation between the two parties over substantially the same trademark disputes, Lucky Brand argued for its interpretation of the 2003 settlement agreement. It moved to dismiss on the basis that because the marks at issue were registered prior to the settlement agreement, Marcel released any claim alleging infringement of those marks. The district court denied the motion, concluding that it was premature to determine which claims were subject to release in the 2001 agreement. However, the district court noted that Lucky Brand was “free to raise the issue . . . again after the record is more fully developed.” Lucky Brand raised the defense again in its answer and as an affirmative defense, but not again during the litigation. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for Marcel, declaring that Lucky Brand infringed on Marcel’s “Get Lucky” trademark and enjoining Lucky Brand from using the “Get Lucky” mark. Lucky Brand did not appeal.</p>
<p>In 2011, Marcel filed another lawsuit against Lucky Brand alleging that the latter continued to use “Lucky Brand” mark after the injunction. Lucky Brand moved for summary judgment on the basis that Marcel’s claims were precluded by res judicata in light of the final disposition of the previous action. The district court agreed, but the Second Circuit reversed, finding the allegedly barred claims “could not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case.” On remand, Marcel filed a second amended complaint, which Lucky Brand moved to dismiss on the sole basis that the 2001 agreement barred Marcel’s claims.

Therefore, the shareholders' claim that FHFA's actions destroyed the value of their ownership interests is not supported by the court's decision to leave the Third Amendment intact.

While the Ninth Circuit attempted to distinguish domestic corporations like Nestlé USA, Inc., from foreign corporations, the allegations in this case primarily involve conduct occurring in the Ivory Coast, which implicates the extraterritoriality concerns raised in *Kiobel*. Additionally, the ATS was not intended to create liability for corporations in the manner alleged here. Therefore, the claims against Nestlé USA, Inc., do not fall within the scope of the ATS, and the case must be dismissed.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the legal principles established by the U.S. Supreme Court in prior cases, particularly *Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.* (2013) and *Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC* (2018). In *Kiobel*, the Court held that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not apply extraterritorially, meaning it cannot be used to address conduct occurring entirely outside the United States. In *Jesner*, the Court further clarified that foreign corporations cannot be sued under the ATS. While the Ninth Circuit attempted to distinguish the domestic defendants (Nestlé USA, Inc. and Cargill, Inc.) from foreign corporations, the allegations in this case primarily concern conduct in the Ivory Coast, which implicates the extraterritoriality concerns raised in *Kiobel*. Additionally, the Supreme Court has consistently limited the scope of the ATS, and there is no clear precedent supporting corporate liability under the ATS for aiding and abetting violations of international law. Therefore, the claims against Nestlé USA, Inc. do not fall within the permissible scope of the ATS, and the case must be dismissed.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the legal precedents and principles established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and its application to corporations. In *Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.*, 569 U.S. 108 (2013), the Court held that the ATS does not apply extraterritorially unless the claims ""touch and concern"" the territory of the United States with sufficient force. In *Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC*, 584 U.S. __ (2018), the Court further clarified that foreign corporations cannot be sued under the ATS. While the Ninth Circuit distinguished the domestic defendants (Nestlé USA, Inc. and Cargill, Inc.) from foreign corporations, the Supreme Court has consistently limited the scope of the ATS in cases involving corporate liability and extraterritorial conduct. The allegations in this case primarily concern conduct occurring in the Ivory Coast, and the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the domestic conduct of Nestlé USA, Inc. sufficiently ""touches and concerns"" the territory of the United States to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality. Therefore, the claims against Nestlé USA, Inc. under the ATS cannot proceed, and the ruling is in favor of the defendant.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the legal principles established in prior U.S. Supreme Court cases, particularly *Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.* (2013) and *Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC* (2018).

While the Ninth Circuit held that domestic corporations could be sued under the ATS and that the specific conduct alleged fell within the statute\'s focus, the Supreme Court has consistently narrowed the scope of the ATS in recent years. The allegations of aiding and abetting, even if true, involve conduct primarily occurring outside the United States, and the connection to U.S. territory is insufficient to overcome the presumption against extraterritorial application of the ATS. Therefore, under the current legal framework, the claims against Nestlé USA, Inc. do not meet the requirements for liability under the ATS, and the Court would rule in favor of Nestlé USA, Inc.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the legal principles established in prior U.S. Supreme Court cases, particularly *Kiobel v.

The plaintiffs\' claims do not sufficiently demonstrate that the domestic conduct of Nestlé USA ""touches and concerns"" the territory of the United States with the force required under *Kiobel*. Additionally, the ATS was not intended to create liability for corporations in this context, as suggested by the Court\'s reasoning in *Jesner*. Therefore, the claims against Nestlé USA, Inc., fail under the ATS, and the Court would rule in favor of the defendant.']",100.0
3277,Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee,2020,"<p>Arizona offers two methods of voting: (1) in-person voting at a precinct or vote center either on election day or during an early-vote period, or (2) “early voting” whereby the voter receives the ballot by mail and either mails back the voted ballot or delivers the ballot to a designated drop-off location.</p>
<p>Arizona law permits each county to choose a vote center or a precinct-based system for in-person voting. In counties using the vote-center system, registered voters may vote at any polling location in the county. In counties using the precinct-based system, registered voters may vote only at the designated polling place in their precinct. About 90% of Arizona’s population lives in counties using the precinct-based system. If a voter arrives at a polling place and is not listed on the voter rolls for that precinct, the voter may cast a provisional ballot. After election day, election officials review all provisional ballots to determine the voter’s identity and address. If officials determine the voter voted out of precinct (OOP), the county discards the ballot in its entirety, even if (as is the case in most instances), the OOP voter properly voted (i.e., was eligible to vote) in most of the races on the ballot. The Democratic National Committee challenged this OOP policy as violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it adversely and disparately affects Arizona’s Native American, Hispanic, and African American citizens.</p>
<p>Arizona law has permitted early voting for over 25 years, allowing voters to request an early vote-by-mail ballot either on a per-election basis or on a permanent basis. Some counties permit voters to drop their early ballots in special drop boxes, but all counties permit the return of early ballots by mail, or in person at a polling place, vote center, or authorized election official’s office. Many voters (particularly minorities) who vote early use third parties to collect and drop off voted ballots, which, until 2016, was permissible. Despite “no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in Arizona,” Republican legislators in 2016 passed H.B. 2023, which criminalized the collection and delivery of another person’s ballot. The DNC challenged H.B. 2023 as violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment because it was enacted with discriminatory intent.</p>
<p>After a ten-day bench trial, the district court found in favor of Arizona on all claims. The DNC appealed, and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. A majority of the full Ninth Circuit agreed to rehear the case en banc, and the court reversed, finding the district court “clearly erred.”</p>

Therefore, as a Supreme Court Justice, I would not rule in favor of the first party, Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al., but would instead affirm the Ninth Circuit\'s decision that the policies in question violate the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment.', ' The facts presented indicate that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection (H.B. 2023) under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The DNC argued that these policies disproportionately affected minority voters, including Native American, Hispanic, and African American citizens. While the district court initially ruled in favor of Arizona, the Ninth Circuit en banc reversed this decision, finding that the district court ""clearly erred."" This suggests that the appellate court found merit in the DNC\'s claims that the policies had a discriminatory impact or intent. As a Supreme Court Justice, I would defer to the appellate court\'s findings unless there were compelling reasons to overturn them. Given the evidence of disparate impact on minority voters and the lack of evidence of fraud justifying H.B. 2023, I would not rule in favor of the first party (Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al.). Instead, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\'s decision, which sided with the DNC.', ' The facts presented indicate that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the law criminalizing third-party ballot collection (H.B. 2023) under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The DNC argued that these policies disproportionately affected minority voters, including Native American, Hispanic, and African American citizens. While the district court and a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit initially ruled in favor of Arizona, the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that the district court ""clearly erred."" This suggests that the appellate court found merit in the DNC\'s claims of disparate impact and discriminatory intent. As a Supreme Court Justice, I would defer to the appellate court\'s findings, particularly given the historical context of voting rights protections and the lack of evidence of fraud to justify H.B. 2023. Therefore, I would rule against the first party, Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al., and uphold the Ninth Circuit\'s decision.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the application of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection (H.B. 2023) as discriminatory practices that disproportionately affect minority voters. The district court initially ruled in favor of Arizona, but the Ninth Circuit en banc reversed this decision, finding that the district court ""clearly erred."" This suggests that the appellate court found substantial evidence that the challenged policies had a disparate impact on minority voters, which is a critical factor under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Additionally, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in voting, and the appellate court\'s decision implies that H.B. 2023 was enacted with discriminatory intent. Given these considerations, the Supreme Court would likely uphold the Ninth Circuit\'s decision, ruling against Arizona and in favor of the DNC. Therefore, the ruling would not be in favor of the first party, Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the application of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection (H.B. 2023) as disproportionately affecting minority voters, which could be seen as a violation of their voting rights. The district court initially ruled in favor of Arizona, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, upon rehearing en banc, reversed this decision, indicating that the district court had ""clearly erred."" This suggests that the appellate court found merit in the DNC\'s claims that the Arizona laws had a discriminatory impact on minority voters. Given the appellate court\'s reversal and the lack of evidence of fraud related to third-party ballot collection, the Supreme Court would likely uphold the appellate court\'s decision, ruling against the first party, Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection (H.B. 2023) as discriminatory practices that disproportionately affect minority voters. The district court initially ruled in favor of Arizona, but the Ninth Circuit en banc reversed this decision, finding that the district court ""clearly erred."" This suggests that the appellate court found sufficient evidence to conclude that Arizona\'s policies had a discriminatory impact on minority voters, which would violate federal voting rights protections. As a Supreme Court Justice, I would defer to the appellate court\'s findings of fact and legal conclusions unless there was a compelling reason to overturn them. Given the appellate court\'s determination that the district court erred, and in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, I would rule against Arizona and in favor of the DNC, upholding the appellate court\'s decision. Therefore, the answer is FALSE, as I would not rule in favor of the first party, Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the application of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection (H.B. 2023) as discriminatory practices that disproportionately affect minority voters. The Ninth Circuit, upon rehearing the case en banc, found that the district court ""clearly erred"" in its initial ruling in favor of Arizona. This suggests that the appellate court found sufficient evidence to support the DNC\'s claims that these policies had a disparate impact on minority voters, which is a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying a citizen the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Given the appellate court\'s findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the Supreme Court would also find that Arizona\'s policies violate these protections, and thus would not rule in favor of the first party, Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al.', ' The facts of the case indicate that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection under H.B. 2023, arguing that these policies violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment due to their disparate impact on minority voters. The district court initially ruled in favor of Arizona, but the Ninth Circuit en banc reversed this decision, finding that the district court ""clearly erred."" This suggests that the appellate court found merit in the DNC\'s claims regarding the discriminatory impact of Arizona\'s voting policies. As a Supreme Court Justice, I would defer to the appellate court\'s findings of fact and legal analysis, particularly given the evidence of disparate impact on minority voters and the lack of evidence of fraud justifying the restrictions. Therefore, I would not rule in favor of Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al.', ' The facts of the case indicate that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection under H.B. 2023, arguing that these policies violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment due to their disparate impact on minority voters.

Given the appellate court\'s reversal and the evidence presented regarding the disparate impact on minority voters, I would not rule in favor of the first party, Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al. The policies in question appear to disproportionately affect minority communities, which raises significant concerns under the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. Therefore, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\'s decision and rule against the first party.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the application of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The evidence presented indicates that the out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection disproportionately affect minority voters in Arizona. The OOP policy results in the complete discarding of ballots cast by eligible voters who mistakenly vote outside their designated precinct, a practice that disproportionately impacts Native American, Hispanic, and African American voters. Additionally, the prohibition on third-party ballot collection, despite the absence of evidence of fraud, imposes a burden on minority voters who are more likely to rely on such assistance. These policies, when considered in the context of historical and social conditions in Arizona, create a discriminatory effect that violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices that result in a denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color. Furthermore, the enactment of H.B. 2023 with discriminatory intent violates the Fifteenth Amendment, which guarantees the right to vote without regard to race. Therefore, the Court rules against Mark Brnovich, Attorney General of Arizona, et al., and in favor of the Democratic National Committee, et al.', ' The reasoning for this decision is based on the application of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) challenged Arizona\'s out-of-precinct (OOP) voting policy and the criminalization of third-party ballot collection (H.B. 2023) as discriminatory practices that disproportionately affect minority voters.
