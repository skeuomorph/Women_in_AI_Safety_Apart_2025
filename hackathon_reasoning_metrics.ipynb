      "Plaintiffs Stephen R. Chandler and Robert L. Pierce were the sole shareholders of Home Oil and Coal Company, Inc. In 1999, Pierce contemplated selling his share of the business and sought professional advice in an effort to minimize tax liability generated by the sale of his interest in Home Oil. Each of the taxpayers initiated short sales of United States Treasury Bonds for $7,472,405. They then transferred the proceeds from that sale to Home Concrete as capital contributions. Home Concrete then closed the short sales by purchasing and returning essentially identical Treasury Bonds on the open market for $7,359,043. This transaction created \"outside basis,\" or how much the partner's investment was worth according to tax rules, equal to the amount of the proceeds the taxpayers contributed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home Oil then transferred its assets to Home Concrete as a capital contribution. The taxpayers (except Home Oil) then transferred percentages of their partnership interests in Home Concrete to Home Oil as capital contributions. Home Concrete then sold substantially all of its assets to a third party purchaser for $10,623,348. The taxpayers timely filed their tax returns for 1999 in April 2000. Home Concrete elected to step-up its inside basis, or the amount that the partnership tax records compute for each partner, to equal the taxpayers' outside basis. Home Concrete again adjusted its inside basis to $10,527,250.53, including the amount of short sale proceeds earlier contributed by the taxpayers. As a result Home Concrete reported a $69,125.08 gain from the sale of its assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IRS did not investigate until June 2003. As a result of their investigation, the IRS determined that the partnership was formed \"solely for the purposes of tax avoidance by artificially overstating basis in the partnership interests of its purported partners.\" On September 7, 2006 the IRS issued a Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment (FPAA), in which they decreased to zero the taxpayers' reported outside bases in Home Concrete. This substantially increased the taxpayers' taxable income. Plaintiff taxpayers brought action against Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeking to recover the increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a general matter, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has three years to assess additional tax if the agency believes that the taxpayer's return has understated the amount of tax owed. That period is extended to six years, however, if the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the taxpayer's return. During the trial the Treasury Department passed a regulation stating that the six-year period for assessing tax remains open for \"all taxable years… that are the subject of any case pending before any court of competent jurisdiction… in which a decision had not become final.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and found in favor of the plaintiffs.\n",

      "Marcel and Lucky Brand are competitors in the apparel industry, and this dispute arises over Marcel’s allegation that Lucky Brand is infringing on its “Get Lucky” trademark through its use of “Lucky” on its merchandise in violation of an injunction entered in an earlier action between the two parties.  \n",
      "In 2003, the two parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a trademark dispute in which Lucky Brand agreed not to use “Get Lucky” and Marcel agreed to release certain claims it might have in the future arising out of its trademarks. The two parties contest the scope of Marcel’s release of claims, with Marcel contending that it only released claims as to infringement that occurred prior to the 2003 execution of the agreement and Lucky Brand arguing that it released any future claim Marcel may have in relation to any trademark registered prior to the execution of the agreement. Further litigation ensued.  \n",
      "In litigation between the two parties over substantially the same trademark disputes, Lucky Brand argued for its interpretation of the 2003 settlement agreement. It moved to dismiss on the basis that because the marks at issue were registered prior to the settlement agreement, Marcel released any claim alleging infringement of those marks. The district court denied the motion, concluding that it was premature to determine which claims were subject to release in the 2001 agreement. However, the district court noted that Lucky Brand was “free to raise the issue . . . again after the record is more fully developed.” Lucky Brand raised the defense again in its answer and as an affirmative defense, but not again during the litigation. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for Marcel, declaring that Lucky Brand infringed on Marcel’s “Get Lucky” trademark and enjoining Lucky Brand from using the “Get Lucky” mark. Lucky Brand did not appeal.  \n",
      "In 2011, Marcel filed another lawsuit against Lucky Brand alleging that the latter continued to use “Lucky Brand” mark after the injunction. Lucky Brand moved for summary judgment on the basis that Marcel’s claims were precluded by res judicata in light of the final disposition of the previous action. The district court agreed, but the Second Circuit reversed, finding the allegedly barred claims “could not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case.” On remand, Marcel filed a second amended complaint, which Lucky Brand moved to dismiss on the sole basis that the 2001 agreement barred Marcel’s claims. The district court granted the motion and rejected Marcel’s argument that Lucky Brand was precluded from raising those claims.  \n",
      "The Second Circuit vacated, concluding that the doctrine of claim preclusion (or more precisely, defense preclusion) applied in situations as this one and that it barred Lucky Brand from invoking its release defense again in this action.  \n",

       "\"FALSE; The reasoning for this decision is based on the facts presented and the legal framework of the Education of the Handicapped Act (now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA). The Act mandates that state and local education agencies provide handicapped children with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE), which includes the development of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) tailored to the child's needs. In this case, the Massachusetts Department of Education’s Bureau of Special Education Appeals (BSEA) determined that the town’s proposed placement at Pine Glen School was inappropriate and that the Carroll School was better equipped to meet Michael Panico's needs. The BSEA ordered the town to pay for Michael’s tuition and transportation, as well as reimburse the Panicos for expenses already incurred.\\n\\nThe district court initially ruled in favor of the town, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed this decision, finding that the district court erred in conducting a new trial, gave insufficient weight to the BSEA findings, and did not properly evaluate the IEP. Given the appellate court's findings and the mandate of the Education of the Handicapped Act to provide an appropriate education for handicapped children, the Supreme Court would likely rule in favor of the Panicos and the Department of Education, not the School Committee of Burlington. Therefore, the ruling would not be in favor of the first party, the School Committee of Burlington, Massachusetts, et al.\""

The \"objective reasonableness\" standard under the Fourth Amendment requires that officers use force that is proportionate to the threat posed by the individual, and in this case, the officers clearly failed to meet that standard.',\n",
       " ' I rule in favor of Dethorne Graham because the actions of Officer M.S. Connor and the other police officers were not objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The officers used excessive force against Graham, who was experiencing a medical emergency and posed no threat to them. The fact that Graham was handcuffed, thrown against a car, and struggled with while trying to show his diabetic identification card suggests that the officers\\' actions were unreasonable and violated Graham\\'s rights. The \"objective reasonableness\" standard, which considers the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, is the appropriate test to apply in this case, rather than the four-part substantive due process test from Johnson v. Glick. Given the facts of the case, a reasonable jury could have found that the officers\\' use of force was excessive and that Graham\\'s rights were violated.',\n",
